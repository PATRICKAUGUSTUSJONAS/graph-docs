##General Information
The current state of the revamped web app is having a limited feature set and is not on par with the existing application. However, the ground work is done and we will now be able to ship new features at a very fast pace. 
The current beta web app is capable of the following things:

- Creating a Project
- Creating Models
- Adding Fields:  
    - Single Line Text
    - Multi Line Text
    - Markdown
    - Code
    - Integer
    - Float
    - Checkbox
- Creating Content for these Fields
- Uploading Assets
- Staging Preview
- API Explorer (API per Stages)

## How to Give Feedback
During the beta we are dependent on your feedback! There may be things that are not working properly or some rough edges, but we still want you to provide us with everything that you find buggy or weird. If you are missing something or got stuck somewhere, just let us know!

You can reach us either through Intercom, our on site chat, or via [Slack](https://slack.graphcms.com) in the locked `#beta` channel. If you need access for that simply message `@fabian` in Slack or [fabian@graphcms.com](mailto:fabian@graphcms.com).

## How to Access
The Beta version is hosted on [https://beta.graphcms.com](https://beta.graphcms.com) and we will whitelist your email for access! If you have trouble logging in, please contact us in Slack.

## What to Expect in the Next Weeks
We will be making daily changes to the web app and the web app will display when a new version is ready.

The final release around the end of may will be mostly feature pair with the "old version" of GraphCMS, so there will be a lot of things coming throughout the beta. For example: Translations, Webhooks, Publish Workflows, Roles...
