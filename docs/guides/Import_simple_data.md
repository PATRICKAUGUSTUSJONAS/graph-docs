# Import simple data

GraphCMS offers a rich UI to insert new data to your project. Often you have a set of structured data in a JSON or CSV format. Entering this data via the UI can be a lot of repetitive work. A much faster way can be using a simple import script.

This guide explains how to import simple structured data into GraphCMS using a NodeJS script. By simple structured data we mean data without relations. It is intended to be a starting point and can be easily adapted for your specific use case.

    The sample project for this guide can be found [here](https://github.com/GraphCMS/example_02_simple_data_import).

## Data structure

In this example, we are going to import a very basic data structure which contains upcoming GraphQL meetup events. It is stored as a single JSON file `data.json`. Every event has the following attributes:

- title (string, required, unique): The title of the event
- event (string, required): The name of the event
- date (string, required): The date of the event in format: "MM.DD.YYYY"
- location (JSON): The geolocation of the event
    - lat (float): latitude
    - lng (float): longitude
- speakers (string, multiple values): A list of speakers of the event
- link (string): A link to further information of the event
- description (string): Short description of the event

First we need to replicate the content model in GraphCMS. To do this, create a new Project in [GraphCMS](https://app.graphcms.com). Create a new content model using `Event` as `apiId`. Adding the fields is pretty straight forward. Click `EDIT FIELDS` and use the `Field Wizard` to create all fields representing your data structure.

You can see all needed fields and their attributes in the screenshots below.

## API Access

By default, `GraphCMS` protects your API against unauthorized access, so nobody can create, read, update or delete any content in your project.

To keep things simple, this guide will write the sample data without setting up an `authToken` for authentication. To allow write operations, you have to allow at least `CREATE` operations on you API. This can be done in the `PUBLIC API ACCESS` section in the `Settings` view of your project. Simply activate the `CREATE` switch as shown in the screenshot below.

Now we are good to go and we can start to write our import script.

## Import script

The script we are going to write reads data from a JSON file and writes the data into a GraphCMS project.

An easy way to do this is to use [Lokka](https://github.com/kadirahq/lokka). It is a lightweight JavaScript GraphQL client library.

We are going to use NodeJS with [Babel](https://babeljs.io) to write ES6 code. To get a cleaner handling for async operations, we use the [transform-async-to-generator](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-async-to-generator) Bable plugin.

    Since GraphQL queries are just simple HTTP request you can use CURL or any other programming language you want.


First we have to setup our Lokka client. To do this, we need to import the required packages and create a new Lokka instance. We use the Lokka http transport to access our API. Additionally we need to pass the URL of our API.

In this example we use the `simple api`. the the URL will look like this: `https://api.graphcms.com/simple/v1/$PROJECTID_OR_ALIAS$`. All you have to do is to replace the `$PROJECTID_OR_ALIAS$` placeholder with your `projectId` or your projectÂ´s `alias`.
You can get this URL by copying it from the `Endpoints` section in the projects settings view:

![Screenshot](../img/guides/simple_import_endpoints.png)

The next code block shows how to setup the Lokka client:

```
import { Lokka } from 'lokka';
import { Transport } from 'lokka-transport-http';

process.env.TZ = 'UTC'

const client = new Lokka({
  transport: new Transport('https://api.graphcms.com/simple/v1/graphcmsexample02'),
});
```

!!! hint ""
    We need to format the date of each event to `ISO-8601`. You have to ensure the timezone is set to `UTC`.


Now we can write a mutation to write an event into your project. To do this, we write a simple method called `createEvent`, which gets an event object as parameter. Since we call the asynchronous `mutate` method of the Lokka client with `await`, we have to mark this method with `async`:

```
const createEvent = async ({ date, description, event, link, location, speakers, title }) => {
  const mutationResult = await client.mutate(`{
    event: createEvent(
      date: "${new Date(Date.parse(date)).toISOString()}"
      description: "${description}"
      event: "${event}"
      isPublished: true
      link: "${link}"
      location: "${JSON.stringify(location).replace(/\"/g, '\\"')}"
      speakers: ${JSON.stringify(speakers)}
      title: "${title}"
    ) {
      id
    }
  }`);
  return mutationResult.event.id;
};
```

!!! hint ""
    To simplify your development process, you can print out your created mutation string and verify it is valid using a tool like [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) or the [GraphCSM API Explorer](http://localhost:8000/Getting_Started/#exploring-the-content-api)

We create and pass a mutation string into the `mutate` method of the Lokka client. This is a simple GraphQL mutation string, so we have to format the incoming data a little bit.

Simple strings like `event` or `description` can simply be passed as they are and have only be quoted.

Dates must be formatted to be `ISO-8601` conform. As noted above, you have to set the process timezone to `UTC`. To format a date string in JavaScript we simply create a new Date object with the parsed date string. Then we can call the `toISOString` method to get the correct formatted date.

Another special case is the speakers array. Since GraphQL expects an array of strings, we have to stringify the array without quoting it. We use the `JSON.stringify` method for this.

The last field is the locations object. Here we have to prepend all quotes with a `\` using a simple regex: `.replace(/\"/g, '\\"')`.
The mutation string which gets passed to the Lokka client looks like this:

```
{
  event: createEvent(
    date: "2017-03-27T00:00:00.000Z"
    description: "Johannes Schickling is the co-founder of @graphcool. Graduated from Entrepreneur First 15/16. His personality type is ENTJ. He is also a tuts+ author and passionate about open source, algorithms, math and technology."
    event: "GraphQL London #3"
    isPublished: true
    link: "https://www.meetup.com/GraphQL-London/events/238027448"
    location: "{\"lat\":51.5257433,\"lng\":-0.1421112}"
    speakers: ["Johannes Schickling"]
    title: "Using GraphQL subscriptions with Apollo"
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

After the mutation is executed we return the id of the inserted record.

In general the script simply loads the data to import from the `data.json` file using a simple `require`:

```
const data = require('../data.json');
```

Then we iterate over each entry and call the `createEvent` method. After all Promises are resolved, we print out the number of inserted entries and their ids.

```
const eventIds = await Promise.all(data.map(createEvent));
console.log(`Finished creating ${eventIds.length} events. Ids:`, eventIds);
```

    We have configured the field `title` to be unique. If you run the script multiple times it will fail, because reimporting would violate the unique key constraint.
