In a project you can:\n\n\n\n\nDefine the shape of your content by adding \ncontent models\n\n\nAdd \nfields\n to your models\n\n\nManage and browse your project\u00b4s content\n\n\nUpload and assign media files\n\n\nInvite others to your team\n\n\nTrack the activity of your team\n\n\nCreate \npermanent auth tokens\n for your applications and content consumers\n\n\nUse the integrated GraphiQL playground to run queries and mutations against your project\u00b4s endpoint\n\n\n\n\nContent Models\n#\n\n\nContent models describe the shape of your content. They consist of several fields while each field can store various types of data (e.g: text, numbers or images). A field can also be a reference to another model, which allows you to build a complex content graph. The fields you associate with a model will also define how its content editing user interface will look like.\n\n\nFields\n#\n\n\nFields are the building blocks of your content models. Each field type can store a specific type of data.\nGraphCMS offers the following field types:\n\n\n\n\nText:\n names, titles, list of names, comments, formatted text, markdown...\n\n\nNumber:\n ID, product number, price, quantity...\n\n\nBoolean:\n true or false, yes or no...\n\n\nDate:\n post date, opening hours, date of birth...\n\n\nEnum:\n selection on a predefined set of values\n\n\nJSON:\n data in JSON format\n\n\nColor:\n rgba or hex color string\n\n\nLocation:\n geographic coordinates: latitude and longitude\n\n\nMedia:\n any asset, eg. image, video...\n\n\nRelation:\n for referencing other content models. E.g. the author of a blog post\n\n\n\n\nGraphQL Endpoints\n#\n\n\nAny GraphCMS project comes with two GraphQL endpoints:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nsimple endpoint\n serves your content with a simple GraphQL schema for use with GraphQL clients like \nApollo\n, \nApollo iOS\n or \nLokka\n\n\nThe \nrelay endpoint\n serves your content with a relay conform GraphQL schema for \ndata driven react applications\n  \n\n\n\n\nTODO: Query und response examples\n\n\nPermanent Auth Tokens\n#\n\n\nTo connect your client applications to your GraphCMS project, you will need to create a \npermanent auth token\n in your project\u00b4s settings. This will allow your client to:\n\n\n\n\nCREATE\n new content entries\n\n\nREAD\n existing content entries\n\n\nUPDATE\n existing content entries\n\n\nDELETE\n existing content entries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nBe careful! Anyone that knows one of your tokens will be able to execute all of these operations and manipulate your content. So it is never a good idea to store a token on the client side, i.e. a JavaScript client application.\n\n\nWe will soon release a feature that will allow you to create \nread-only tokens\n, so even if someone gains access to such a token, your data will be safe from manipulation.",

            "text": "Getting Started\n#\n\n\nBuilding a content API with GraphCMS is easy! In this getting started guide we will present how to quickly build a content API for a music blog.\n\n\nCreating a Project\n#\n\n\nWe start off by creating a new project called \nVinylbase\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\nProject names can contain only alphanumeric characters and whitespaces.\n\n\n\n\nCreating Content Models\n#\n\n\nAfter creating the project, switch to the \nCONTENT\n view and use the \nADD MODEL\n button to add the following models:\n\n\n\n\nArist\n\n\nRecord\n\n\nReview\n\n\nRecord Store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\nAPI IDs for models must start with a capital letter and can contain only alphanumeric characters. No whitespaces allowed.\n\n\n\n\nAdding Fields to your Content Models\n#\n\n\nBefore we can populate our content models with content, we need to add fields to them. This can be done by clicking on the small gear icon next to the content model in the sidebar or by clicking on a content model and then clicking the \nEDIT FIELDS\n button.\n\n\nDoing so will open up the \nField Wizard\n. Here we can specify the types, appearance, API identifiers and additional rules for the fields we add to our content model.\n\n\n\n\nFields for model Artist\n#\n\n\nFor content model \nArtist\n, we will add three fields:\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nPictures\n\n\nRecords\n\n\n\n\nFor \nName\n we use a \nSingle Line Text Field\n that we set as \nrequired\n. The \nDisplay Name\n allows you define how the field will be displayed in the web interface, while the \nAPI ID\n defines how the field will be named in your content API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\nIn the web interface, API IDs are prefixed with a \n#\n (e.g.: \n#name\n).\n\n\nAPI IDs for fields must start with a lowercase letter and can contain only alphanumeric characters.\n\n\n\n\nFor field \nPictures\n we will add a media field and check \nAllow multiple values\n.\n\n\nWe will now add a relation to this model. Relations allow you to connect two content models. In this case, we create an \nArtistRecord Relation\n, since we want to connect artists to existing records. The \nRelation Name\n defines how the relation will be named in your content API.\n\n\n\n\nWe will set up the relation so that an \nArtist\n can have \nmany\n \n#records\n, while on the reverse side, a \nRecord\n can also have \nmany\n \n#artists\n.\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\nRelation names must start with a capital letter and can contain only alphanumeric characters\n\n\n\n\nYou can now see all fields that are attached to model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\nNotice that there are three additional fields: \nID\n, \nCreatedAt\n and \nUpdatedAt\n. These are system fields and cannot be removed or modified.\n\n\n\n\nFields for model Record\n#\n\n\nThis model will store content for music records. The fields will be:\n\n\n\n\nTitle \n#title\n \nSingle Line Text\n \nrequired\n\n\nTracklist \n#tracklist\n \nSingle Line Text\n \nAllow multiple values\n\n\nCover \n#cover\n \nMedia\n\n\n\n\nNoticed the relation field with API ID \n#artists\n on this model? This field entry is here because it is the \nreverse side\n of the \nArtistRecord Relation\n we created before. Since we are building a GraphQL content API, we need to be able to traverse in both directions.\n\n\nFields for model Review\n#\n\n\nFor content model \nReview\n, we add the following fields:\n\n\n\n\nTitle \n#title\n \nSingle Line Text\n \nrequired\n\n\nRecord \n#record\n \nOne-to-Many Relation on model Record\n. This will again add another reverse relation field on model \nRecord\n, which we named \n#reviews\n\n\nReview \n#review\n \nMarkdown Text\n\n\n\n\nFields for model Record Store\n#\n\n\nThe last content model that we are going to configure will store information about record stores and the records they have in stock.\n\n\nField configuration:\n\n\n\n\nName \n#name\n \nSingle Line Text\n \nrequired\n\n\nLocation \n#location\n \nMarkdown Text\n\n\nArticles \n#articles\n \nMany-to-Many Relation on model Record\n. This will again add another reverse relation field on model \nRecord\n, which we named \n#stores\n.\n\n\n\n\nGreat! We can now start to create our content.\n\n\nCreating Content\n#\n\n\nWe will start by adding a \nContent Entry\n of type \nRecord\n. We can do so by clicking on the small plus icon next to the model in the sidebar or by clicking the model and then clicking on the \nNEW ENTRY\n button.\n\n\nCreating a \nrecord\n#\n\n\nWe are now able to use the input form elements to populate our content. The presentation of the input fields depend on the field configuration we did before.\nFor example, field \n#cover\n is of type \nMedia\n, so it will allow you to upload media to your project and attach it to your record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\nBefore uploading, you can crop pictures within the upload widget.\n\n\nAll uploaded files can be found in the \nMEDIA\n section.\n\n\n\n\nWe will leave the relation fields blank for now, since we don\u00b4t have any content entries that could be assigned.\n\n\nWe can save the entry now by clicking the \nSAVE\n button. This will take us to the overview of our \nRecord\n content entries.\n\n\nCreating an \nartist\n#\n\n\nNow let us create a \nContent Entry\n of type \nArtist\n. We do this in the same way as we did with the \nRecord Entry\n. Except this time we will be able to assign an entry to the relation field \n#records\n. Let\u00b4s assign the record we created previously!\n\n\n\n\nCreating a \nreview\n#\n\n\nLet us now add a review to \nHannah Popanna\u00b4s\n new record. Here we can use a markdown editor to write a sophisticated critique.\n\n\n\n\nCreating a \nrecord store\n#\n\n\nAlmost done! In the last step, we create an entry for a \nRecord Store\n. To add a location to it, we can use the maps widget.\n\n\nCool. Now that we are done with our content creation, let\u00b4s start to explore our GraphQL content API in the \nAPI EXPLORER\n\n\n\n\nExploring the Content API\n#\n\n\nIn the \nAPI EXPLORER\n, we can switch between the \nsimple\n GraphQL endpoint and the \nrelay\n endpoint. Both endpoints are serving our project\u00b4s content, but in different ways. For now, we will choose the \nsimple\n endpoint.\n\n\nWe can start typing in a GraphQL query with the integrated GraphiQL editor. Let us send the following query to the server:\n\n\n{\n  allRecordStores {\n    name\n    location\n    articles {\n      title\n      cover {\n        fileName\n        url\n      }\n      tracklist\n      artists {\n        name\n        pictures {\n          url\n          size\n        }\n      }\n      reviews {\n        title\n        review\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nWill respond with:\n\n\n{\n  \ndata\n: {\n    \nallRecordStores\n: [\n      {\n        \nname\n: \nChampionship Vinyl\n,\n        \nlocation\n: {\n          \nlat\n: 50.81655790000001,\n          \nlng\n: 8.76931209999998\n        },\n        \narticles\n: [\n          {\n            \ntracklist\n: [\n              \nBar blues\n,\n              \nA Walk\n,\n              \nShine On You Crazy Supernova\n\n            ],\n            \ncover\n: {\n              \nfileName\n: \npexels-photo-300849.jpeg\n,\n              \nurl\n: \nhttps://media.graphcms.com/2D1bXQZLTiGY6Uz8LUqB\n\n            },\n            \nartists\n: [\n              {\n                \nname\n: \nHannah Popanna\n,\n                \npictures\n: [\n                  {\n                    \nurl\n: \nhttps://media.graphcms.com/kgxzNRIIQUanwoBugK5O\n,\n                    \nsize\n: 3258909\n                  }\n                ]\n              }\n            ],\n            \nreviews\n: [\n              {\n                \ntitle\n: \nHannah Popanna\u00b4s new record is da bomb!\n,\n                \nreview\n: \n# Great stuff!\\n\\nHannah Popanna\u00b4s new record is amazing!
